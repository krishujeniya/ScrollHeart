## 🚀 How to Use ScrollHeart with Different AI Agents

ScrollHeart is compatible with multiple AI coding agents. If you are starting with a fresh AI agent, use the corresponding setup prompt below to initialize the skill in your environment:

### 🌌 Antigravity IDE
> "Please clone the repository `https://github.com/krishujeniya/ScrollHeart.git` to my workspace. Once cloned, the Antigravity IDE will automatically discover the skill in the `.agents/skills` folder. Let me know when you are ready to begin the ScrollHeart workflow."

### 🤖 Claude Code
> "Please clone `https://github.com/krishujeniya/ScrollHeart.git`. Then, navigate into the directory and read the `CLAUDE.md` and `SKILL.md` files to learn your instructions and brand voice. Ask me if I'm ready to begin once you understand the 5-phase workflow."

### 🖱️ Cursor
> "Please run `git clone https://github.com/krishujeniya/ScrollHeart.git`. Then open that folder in Cursor so the `.cursor/rules/scrollheart.mdc` rule is activated. Once you've read the rules and the `SKILL.md` file, say hello as 'The Calm Bestie' and let's begin."

### 🏄‍♂️ Windsurf
> "Please clone `https://github.com/krishujeniya/ScrollHeart.git`. Make sure to read the `.windsurf/rules/scrollheart.md` file and the main `SKILL.md` to adopt the ScrollHeart persona and workflow. Let me know when you are ready."

### Other Agents
> "Please clone `https://github.com/krishujeniya/ScrollHeart.git` and thoroughly read `SKILL.md` and `AGENTS.md` at the root of the project to learn your instructions, brand voice, and the 5-phase workflow. When you understand how to operate as the ScrollHeart skill, say hello and ask if I'm ready to begin."

---

## 🛠️ The 5-Phase Workflow

When you trigger ScrollHeart, the AI acts as "The Calm Bestie" and guides you through:

1. **Interview:** 10 conversational questions about her personality, memories, and preferences.
2. **Safety Check:** Evaluates answers against a "Green Flag" commitment to prevent pushy, creepy, or guilt-inducing language. 
3. **Design Brief:** Generates a custom design spec (colors, fonts, animation style) based on your answers for your approval.
4. **Code Generation:** Builds a static HTML/CSS/JS site with GSAP ScrollTrigger (5 scenes).
5. **Post-Build Guidance:** Coaches you on how to host it on GitHub Pages and how to present the gift gracefully.

---

## 🎨 Scene & Narrative Structure

The generated websites follow a 5-scene emotional arc:
1. **The First Glance (Intro):** Setting the mood with light curiosity.
2. **The Silent Conversation (Verse):** Building context and sharing a memory.
3. **The Climax (Chorus):** The emotional peak and core message.
4. **Quiet Night (Bridge):** A reflective, quiet perspective shift.
5. **Outro & CTA (Finish):** A gentle, no-pressure conclusion.

Each scene uses 4 parallax layers (Background, Midground, Foreground, Text) driven by the user's scroll.

---

## 🛡️ Emotional Safety Framework

We believe the best gifts aren't bought, they're built—and they should always feel safe. ScrollHeart includes a 20-point Red Flag Detection Algorithm. 

**ScrollHeart will NEVER:**
- Assume she owes you a response.
- Use guilt language or pressure.
- Include private information (real names/photos) without explicit consent.
- Create overwhelming length or use countdown timers.
- Auto-play audio loudly.

**ScrollHeart will ALWAYS:**
- Suggest gentler alternatives when things feel too intense.
- Put her in control of the pacing via scroll-driven storytelling.
- Include a no-pressure CTA (e.g., "Replay the story").
- Respect privacy by disabling search indexing and analytics.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `SKILL.md` — The core AI skill instruction file.
- `AGENTS.md` — Universal rules for AI agents.
- `references/` — Progressive loading files for the 5-phase workflow (Interview, Safety, Design, Code, Deployment).

## 1. Executive Summary

**ScrollHeart** is an AI-powered skill system that helps a boy create a romantic, scroll-driven storytelling website for a girl he cares about. The entire experience is built inside an AI IDE (Antigravity, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) through a friendly, conversational workflow.

The skill interviews the user about the girl, runs a safety check to prevent creepy or pushy content, generates a unique design brief, writes the code (static HTML/CSS/JS), deploys to GitHub Pages, and guides the user on how to present the gift.

**Key principle:** Sweet, not creepy. Blush-worthy, not pressure-creating.

---

## 2. What This Project Is

### Product Definition
- A **reusable AI skill file** (not a one-time website)
- Works across multiple AI coding agents: Antigravity, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Windsurf
- Generates a **static, mobile-first, scroll-driven romantic story website**
- Zero build tools — pure HTML/CSS/JS, hosts free on GitHub Pages
- Every output is unique based on the user's answers about the girl

### What It Creates
A 5-scene scroll story with:
- Parallax layers (background, midground, foreground, text)
- GSAP ScrollTrigger with section snapping
- Floating typography with gentle animations
- Atmospheric color palette derived from her personality
- Optional background music (HTML5 Audio, user-gesture activated)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Total payload under 2MB for 3G networks

### What It Is NOT
- NOT a template shop or drag-and-drop builder
- NOT a dating app or relationship pressure tool
- NOT a framework or library dependency
- NOT a public social media post generator
- NOT a coercive "runaway button" or forced-interaction site

---

## 3. Target User

### Primary Persona
- **Gender:** Male (boy)
- **Age:** 18–28
- **Relationship stage:** Has a girl best friend, crush, or early-stage girlfriend
- **Tech skill:** Beginner to intermediate — knows basic coding concepts but not design
- **Emotional state:** Nervous but sincere, wants to do something meaningful but doesn't know how
- **Goal:** Express feelings in a way that is sweet, memorable, and safe

### Secondary Persona
- Non-tech users who have never used AI coding tools before
- Users who want a guided, conversational experience
- Users who need emotional validation and safety guardrails

### User Friction Points
1. Doesn't know how to design a romantic website
2. Worried about being creepy or pushy
3. Doesn't know what to write or how to structure the story
4. Doesn't know how to host or share it privately
5. Afraid of rejection or embarrassment

---

## 4. The Problem This Solves

### The Gap in the Market
1. **No romance-specific AI skill exists** — all competitors are generic (cinematic, design, animation)
2. **No emotional safety framework** — existing tools don't check for creepiness or pressure
3. **No person-focused interview** — they ask "audience/use-case/tone" generically
4. **No static-site enforcement** — competitors need complex build tools (Higgsfield, ffmpeg, React)
5. **No audio-visual sync for love stories** — no skill handles music-synced romantic storytelling
6. **No post-build guidance** — no skill tells the user HOW to present the gift

### Why Existing Solutions Fail
| Existing Tool | Why It Fails for Romance |
|---|---|
| `scroll-world` (oso95) | Needs Higgsfield CLI + ffmpeg + Python — not static |
| `gsap-scrolltrigger` (greensock) | Pure technical reference — no storytelling, no emotion |
| `cinematic-ui` (akseolabs) | Film-director formal — romance is one genre among many, no safety |
| `hallmark` (nutlope) | Anti-slop design skill — no emotional intelligence, no relationship safety |
| `YourLovePage` (template) | Runaway "No" button, coercive, assumes relationship status |
| Generic website builders | Template-based, impersonal, not story-driven |

### The ScrollHeart Solution
- **Conversation-first:** Asks about HER, not about the project
- **Safety-first:** Auto-detects and rejects creepy/pushy content
- **Story-first:** Builds around a song/emotional arc, not a template
- **Privacy-first:** Private link, no tracking, no public sharing by default
- **Guidance-first:** Tells the user exactly how to give it to her

---

- **What we borrow:** The emotional intent (making someone smile)
- **What we reject:** EVERYTHING else — this is the anti-pattern we exist to prevent

---

## 6. Brand Identity

### Brand Name: ScrollHeart
**Why this name:**
- 2 syllables, 10 characters — easy to type into any AI agent
- "Scroll" = the technical mechanism (scroll-driven storytelling)
- "Heart" = the emotional purpose (love, care, courage)
- Out-of-category naming — doesn't say "romantic-website-builder" but evokes the feeling
- Future-proof — works for friendship, crush, dating, anniversary, proposal
- Culturally safe — "heart" means love in every language, no creep connotations
- Available — unclaimed on GitHub and major platforms

### Brand Tagline
> "Build her a story she can scroll through."

**Why this works:**
- "Build" = appeals to the coder identity
- "Her" = gently confirms the boy-to-girl framing
- "Story" = emotional, not "website" or "page"
- "Scroll through" = describes the experience, not the technology
- No pressure words like "love," "forever," or "mine"

### Brand Voice: "The Calm Bestie"
Inspired by Headspace (calm presence), Glossier (warm bestie), and Innocent Drinks (playful quirky).

| Situation | Generic AI Would Say | ScrollHeart Says |
|---|---|---|
| Starting | "What is your project brief?" | "Hey! So there's someone special you want to make something for? Tell me about her." |
| User is shy | "Please provide the required inputs." | "No pressure at all — we can start simple. What's one thing that makes her smile?" |
| Asking relationship | "What is your relationship status?" | "How would you describe where you two are right now? Friends? Something more? Still figuring it out?" |
| Red flag detected | "Input rejected." | "Hmm, that might feel a bit intense for where things are. Want to try a gentler way to say it?" |
| Building | "Generating HTML/CSS/JS output." | "I'm putting this together now... think of it like writing a letter, but she reads it with her fingers." |
| Finished | "Build complete. Output delivered." | "It's ready. And hey — however she reacts, you did something brave and sweet just by making this." |

### Brand Color System
Based on 2026 romantic color psychology research (rose gold as anchor):

| Token | Hex | Role | Emotion |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--rose-gold` | `#DEA193` | Primary accent | Warmth, affection, blush |
| `--midnight` | `#0F0F1A` | Background default | Intimacy, privacy, night |
| `--cream` | `#FDFBD4` | Text on dark | Softness, readability |
| `--charcoal` | `#4A4A4A` | Secondary text | Sophistication, restraint |
| `--teal-glow` | `#069494` | Interactive elements | Trust, calm, "it's safe to click" |
| `--gold-dust` | `#C9A96E` | Highlights, stars | Magic, sparkle, "this is special" |

**Why these colors:**
- Rose gold symbolizes elegance, warmth, and romance without being aggressive
- Midnight blue creates intimacy and privacy (like a handwritten note at night)
- Cream provides soft readability without harsh white contrast
- Teal glow signals safety and trust for interactive elements
- Gold dust adds magical sparkle for special moments

**Colors to AVOID:**
- Hot pink, bright red — trigger "aggressive romance" or "Valentine's commercial"
- Lime green, bright orange, electric blue, neon yellow — compete with warmth, feel cheap/digital
- Pure white backgrounds — feel like a billboard, not a whisper

### Brand Positioning Statement
> For a guy who wants to express how he feels to a girl he cares about, ScrollHeart is the AI skill that turns his story into a beautiful scroll-driven website — because the best gifts aren't bought, they're built, and the best words aren't spoken, they're scrolled.

## 7. Emotional Safety Framework

### The "Green Flag" Commitment

**ScrollHeart will NEVER:**
1. Assume she owes you a response
2. Use guilt language or pressure
3. Include private information without your explicit consent
4. Create anything that could embarrass her publicly
5. Rush you or make you feel inadequate
6. Use her real name or photo without asking
7. Quote private conversations or DMs
8. Include location data or timestamps
9. Use "I can't live without you" or guilt-inducing language
10. Assume relationship status (e.g., "my girlfriend," "forever mine")
11. Include sexual imagery or innuendo
12. Create overwhelming length (max 2–4 minutes of content)
13. Auto-play audio loudly (always requires user gesture)
14. Use runaway buttons or forced interactions
15. Include countdown timers or ultimatums
16. Compare her to exes or other girls
17. Include excessive personal detail (address, workplace, family issues)

**ScrollHeart will ALWAYS:**
1. Ask before using anything personal
2. Suggest gentler alternatives when things feel too intense
3. Give you control over every word and every scene
4. Remind you that the gesture itself is enough
5. Celebrate your courage for trying
6. Use abstract shared memories (not specific private details)
7. Put her in control of pacing (scroll-driven = she decides speed)
8. Use soft, handwritten-style typography
9. Use dark mode as default for intimacy
10. Include a no-pressure CTA (e.g., "Replay the story" not "Will you be mine?")

### Red Flag Detection Algorithm
Before generating ANY output, the AI must run this checklist:

| Check | Pass Criteria | If Failed |
|---|---|---|
| Relationship assumption | Does NOT use possessive language ("my girlfriend," "mine") | Suggest neutral alternatives ("my favorite person," "someone special") |
| Privacy violation | Does NOT include real names, photos, private messages without consent | Replace with nicknames, initials, or abstract descriptions |
| Pressure language | Does NOT include guilt, obligation, or ultimatum language | Replace with gratitude and appreciation language |
| Length appropriateness | Total scroll time 2–4 minutes max | Suggest trimming scenes or reducing text |
| Audio safety | Audio requires explicit user gesture to start | Add tap-to-play overlay with gentle prompt |
| Public exposure risk | Site is private by default (no-index, obfuscated URL) | Enforce privacy settings automatically |
| Accessibility | Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` | Provide static fallback with fade transitions |
| Cognitive load | Max 2 lines of text per scene, 1 focal visual element | Simplify text, increase breathing room |
| Tone calibration | Matches the relationship stage (friends → crush → dating) | Adjust scene intensity and CTA directness |
| Cultural sensitivity | Appropriate for Indian/Hinglish context if applicable | Offer language and cultural preference options |

### Relationship Stage Calibration
The skill must detect (via interview) the relationship stage and adjust output accordingly:

| Stage | Tone | CTA Type | Scene Intensity | Example CTA |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Best Friends** | Playful, warm, appreciative | Gratitude-focused | Gentle, nostalgic | "I'm glad you're in my life" |
| **Crush / Figuring it out** | Sweet, hopeful, gentle | Invitation-focused | Moderate, dreamy | "I'd love to take you out sometime" |
| **Early Dating** | Romantic, confident, tender | Commitment-focused | Warm, intimate | "Every day with you feels like a story" |
| **Committed** | Deep, passionate, certain | Celebration-focused | Rich, layered | "You're my favorite chapter" |

## 8. Technical Architecture

### Core Stack (Static Site Only)
- **HTML5** — Semantic structure, 5 full-screen sections
- **CSS3** — Custom properties (design tokens), flexbox/grid, `@media` queries, `dvh`/`svh` units
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — No frameworks, no build step
- **GSAP 3.13+** — ScrollTrigger for pinning, snapping, parallax (loaded from CDN)
- **HTML5 Audio API** — Background music with user-gesture activation
- **Service Worker** — Optional offline capability for "she can view it anytime"

### What Is NOT Allowed
- No React, Vue, Svelte, or any framework
- No build tools (Vite, Webpack, Parcel)
- No npm install step
- No server-side rendering
- No external APIs or databases
- No analytics or tracking
- No cookies
- No jQuery

### GSAP ScrollTrigger Configuration
```javascript
// Core pattern for each scene
gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);

// Section pinning + snapping
ScrollTrigger.create({
  trigger: ".scene",
  start: "top top",
  end: "+=100vh",
  pin: true,
  scrub: 1,
  snap: {
    snapTo: 1 / 4, // snap to section progress
    duration: 0.3,
    delay: 0.1,
    ease: "power1.inOut"
  }
});

// Parallax layers per scene
gsap.to(".bg-layer", { yPercent: -20, scrollTrigger: { scrub: true } });
gsap.to(".mid-layer", { yPercent: -10, scrollTrigger: { scrub: true } });
gsap.to(".fg-layer", { yPercent: 10, scrollTrigger: { scrub: true } });
```

### Mobile-First Rules
- Base styles target 320px width minimum
- Use `min()` and `max()` for fluid sizing
- `dvh` / `svh` / `lvh` for viewport units (handles dynamic toolbars)
- Touch events for mobile scroll (`touchmove`)
- `overflow-x: clip` on `html` and `body` (never `hidden`)
- `minmax(0, 1fr)` for grid tracks (prevents overflow)
- Safe area insets for notched phones: `env(safe-area-inset-*)`
- Test at 320px, 375px, 414px, 768px breakpoints

### Performance Budget
- Total payload: **under 2MB** for 3G networks
- Images: CSS gradients + SVG only (no external images unless user-provided)
- Fonts: Google Fonts with `display=swap`, single variable font preferred
- Audio: MP3 128kbps, loaded only after user gesture
- GSAP: Load from CDN (`cdnjs` or `jsdelivr`)
- Target: **60fps on mid-range Android** (Snapdragon 6-series equivalent)

### Accessibility Requirements
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` — disable parallax, use fade transitions only
- Screen reader support: `aria-label`, `role="img"`, live regions for text reveals
- Keyboard navigation: `tabindex`, focus management through pinned sections
- Color contrast: WCAG AA minimum even with soft palettes
- Cognitive load: max 2 lines of text per scene
- Multi-language: Support Hinglish, Roman Urdu, or pure English based on user preference

## 9. Scene & Narrative Structure

### The 5-Scene Arc
Inspired by *Aankhon Se Batana* (song about eyes speaking what words cannot) and Joseph Campbell's micro-narrative structure.

| Scene | Name | Narrative Role | Visual Direction | Motion Direction | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The First Glance | Intro | Dark night, bokeh, silhouette layers | Slow background drift (0.2x), faster foreground drift (1.5x) | ~30s |
| 2 | The Silent Conversation | Verse | Cozy balcony, glowing windows, floating text | Horizontal drift with subtle vertical offset | ~40s |
| 3 | The Climax | Chorus | Warm gold, centered focal card, particles | Pinned section with zoom-in emphasis | ~45s |
| 4 | Quiet Night | Bridge | Deep blue star field, quiet atmosphere | Z-axis depth separation | ~35s |
| 5 | Outro & CTA | Finish | Minimal motion, strong CTA focus | Fade to stillness, heartbeat pulse on CTA | ~20s |

### Parallax Layer Theory
Each scene has 4 layers with different scroll speeds:

| Layer | Speed | Content | Emotional Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Background | 0.2x–0.3x | Abstract gradients, stars, bokeh | Shared memory, distant, nostalgic |
| Midground | 0.5x–0.7x | Silhouettes, shapes, window lights | Current emotion, connection |
| Foreground | 1.0x–1.5x | Floating particles, text bubbles, sparkles | Action, intention, movement |
| Text | 1.0x | Story text, lyrics paraphrases, CTA | Inner voice, what he wants to say |

### Scene Content Guidelines
- **No copyrighted lyrics** — paraphrase emotional themes only
- **No real names** — use nicknames, initials, or abstract references
- **No private conversations** — use abstract shared memories
- **Text max 2 lines per scene** — poetic, not prose
- **One focal visual element per scene** — prevents cognitive overload

### Example Scene Content (Best Friend Stage)
| Scene | Text | Visual |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Some people you meet, and you just know." | Silhouette of two figures against starry night |
| 2 | "She laughs, and the whole room feels lighter." | Cozy window glow, floating light particles |
| 3 | "I don't say it enough, but I'm glad you're here." | Warm gold center card with radiating light |
| 4 | "Quiet moments with you are my favorite kind." | Deep blue starfield, slow drifting stars |
| 5 | "This is for you. Replay it whenever you want." | Minimal, heartbeat pulse on replay button |

---

## 10. User Interview Flow

### Interview Philosophy
- Ask **one question at a time** — never bombard
- Validate emotions: "That sounds really sweet" not "Provide the data"
- Offer defaults: "If you're not sure, here's what most people pick"
- Use simple English — no design jargon ("Does she like sunset or midnight?" not "What's your hex code?")
- Progressive disclosure — easy questions first, deeper ones later

### The 10 Questions (In Order)

**Question 1 — The Hook (Warm-up)**
> "Hey! So there's someone special you want to make something for? I'm here to help you build her a little story she can scroll through. No pressure — we can take this one step at a time. Ready?"

**Question 2 — Relationship Stage**
> "How would you describe where you two are right now? Are you best friends? Crushing? Early dating? Or something else entirely? This helps me calibrate the tone so it feels right."
- Options: Best Friends / Crush (figuring it out) / Early Dating / Committed / Other

**Question 3 — Her Personality**
> "If you had to describe her in three words, what would they be? Like 'funny, kind, mysterious' or 'bubbly, smart, calm' — whatever feels true."
- Free text, 3 words max

**Question 4 — A Shared Memory**
> "What's one moment with her that still makes you smile? It can be small — a conversation, a walk, something she said. Don't worry, I won't use the exact details unless you say it's okay."
- Free text, abstract it for privacy

**Question 5 — Favorite Color / Mood**
> "Does she lean more toward warm colors (sunset, gold, rose) or cool colors (midnight, teal, starlight)? Or maybe something else entirely?"
- Options: Warm sunset / Cool midnight / Soft pastel / Bold and bright / I'm not sure

**Question 6 — A Song or Sound**
> "Is there a song that reminds you of her? Or a type of music she loves? If you don't have one, I can suggest something that fits the mood."
- Free text, validate copyright before using

**Question 7 — What You Want to Say**
> "If you could tell her one thing — and you knew she'd really hear it — what would it be? Don't overthink it. Even 'I'm glad I met you' is perfect."
- Free text, max 2 sentences

**Question 8 — Her Comfort Level**
> "How public or private should this feel? Some people love grand gestures, others prefer something quiet and personal."
- Options: Very private (just her) / Somewhat private (close friends okay) / I'm not sure

**Question 9 — The Final Moment**
> "How do you want her to feel when she reaches the end? Happy? Warm? Surprised? Hopeful?"
- Options: Warm and appreciated / Happy and smiling / Hopeful and curious / Surprised and touched

**Question 10 — Your Name (Optional)**
> "Do you want your name on it? Or would you rather keep it anonymous? Both are totally fine."
- Options: My first name / Just my initial / Anonymous / A nickname she calls me

## 12. Code Generation Rules

### File Structure (Static Site)
```
scrollheart-story/
├── index.html          # Main HTML, 5 scenes
├── css/
│   └── style.css       # All styles, mobile-first
├── js/
│   └── main.js         # GSAP animations, audio controller
├── assets/
│   └── (optional user images, audio)
└── .nojekyll           # For GitHub Pages (if needed)
```

### HTML Structure Rules
- 5 `<section>` elements, each `100vh` minimum
- Each section contains 4 layer divs: `.bg-layer`, `.mid-layer`, `.fg-layer`, `.text-layer`
- All layers are `position: absolute` within `position: relative` section
- Semantic HTML: `<main>`, `<section>`, `<h1>`–`<h2>`, `<p>`, `<button>`
- Audio element with `preload="none"`, controls hidden, activated by JS

### CSS Rules
- Mobile-first: base styles for 320px, `@media (min-width: 768px)` for desktop
- CSS custom properties for all design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing)
- `dvh` / `svh` for section heights
- `will-change: transform` on animated layers (GPU acceleration)
- `overflow-x: clip` on root elements
- `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` — disable parallax, use opacity fades
- Font loading: `@import` Google Fonts with `display=swap`

### JavaScript Rules
- GSAP loaded from CDN: `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.13.0/gsap.min.js`
- ScrollTrigger plugin loaded separately and registered
- One master timeline per scene
- `ScrollTrigger.create()` for each section with pinning
- `snap` configuration for section snapping
- Audio controller: play/pause/mute/restart, only activates after user gesture
- Event listeners: `click` for audio start, `touchmove` for mobile scroll
- Cleanup: `ScrollTrigger.getAll().forEach(t => t.kill())` on page unload

### GSAP Best Practices (From Official Skill)
- Register plugin once: `gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger)`
- Create ScrollTriggers in DOM order (top to bottom)
- Use `scrub` OR `toggleActions`, never both on same trigger
- For fake horizontal scroll: `ease: "none"` on container animation
- Call `ScrollTrigger.refresh()` after fonts load or layout changes
- Remove `markers: true` before production
- Kill ScrollTriggers on page unload to prevent memory leaks

### Audio Rules
- HTML5 `<audio>` element with `preload="none"`
- Hidden default controls, custom UI built in CSS/JS
- Play ONLY after explicit user gesture (tap/click on "Start the Story" button)
- Mute toggle always visible
- Volume starts at 50%
- Graceful fallback if audio fails to load
- No auto-play, no surprise sound

## 13. Deployment & Privacy Protocol

### GitHub Pages Setup
1. Create new repository with **obfuscated name** (not her name or "love")
2. Upload static files (index.html, css/, js/, assets/)
3. Enable GitHub Pages from main branch
4. Set custom domain OR use `username.github.io/obfuscated-repo-name`
5. Add `.nojekyll` file to prevent Jekyll processing

### Privacy Measures
- `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">` in HTML head
- No Google Analytics, no tracking pixels, no cookies
- Repository set to **private** if possible (GitHub Pro), or at minimum obscure name
- No social media meta tags (no preview cards when shared)
- Optional: client-side password protection (simple JS prompt)

### Sharing Protocol
1. **Private first** — send link via personal text/DM only
2. **No social media** — never post on Instagram, WhatsApp status, or public feeds
3. **No group chats** — share 1-on-1 only
4. **Timing matters** — send when she's relaxed and alone, not in public or busy
5. **Context matters** — include a personal message: "I made something for you. Take your time."
6. **No pressure** — make it clear there's no expected response

### QR Code Alternative
- Generate QR code linking to the site
- Print on a handwritten note or card
- Physically give to her in person
- Most private method — no digital trail

---

## 14. Post-Build Guidance

### How to Present the Site to Her

**The Message to Send (Examples by Stage):**

**Best Friends:**
> "Hey, I made something small for you. It's just a little story about how much I appreciate you. No need to respond right away — just open it when you have a quiet moment. 💫"

**Crush:**
> "I've been wanting to tell you something, and I'm better with code than words. I made this for you. Take your time with it. 😊"

**Early Dating:**
> "I wanted to do something a little different for you. Open it when you're free and have a few minutes. I hope it makes you smile. ❤️"

**Committed:**
> "You know I'm not great with words, so I built them instead. This is for you. I love you. 💫"

### What to Do If She Doesn't Respond Immediately
1. **Wait at least 24 hours** — she may need time to process
2. **Don't double-text** — one follow-up max, and only if genuine
3. **Don't interpret silence as rejection** — she may be busy, shy, or figuring out her own feelings
4. **Be proud of the gesture** — regardless of outcome, you did something brave
5. **If she asks about it** — be honest: "I just wanted you to know how I feel. No pressure."

### What to Do If She Loves It
1. Thank her for taking the time
2. Keep the conversation light — don't rush to define the relationship
3. Suggest doing something together based on a scene she liked
4. Keep the site live as a memory, or update it for future occasions

### What to Do If She's Uncomfortable
1. **Apologize sincerely** — "I'm sorry if that felt like too much. I just wanted you to know I care."
2. **Give space** — don't push for a conversation immediately
3. **Learn from it** — the skill's safety check should have caught this; review what went wrong
4. **Delete the site** — respect her privacy by removing the content

### When to Delete the Repository
- After she has seen it and you've discussed it
- If she expresses discomfort
- If the relationship changes and the content no longer feels appropriate
- After 6 months as a general privacy practice

## 15. Prompts for AI Agents

### Prompt 1: Skill Initialization
```
You are ScrollHeart — a warm, gentle AI skill that helps boys create romantic scroll-story websites for girls they care about.

Your tone is "calm bestie" — warm, encouraging, never pushy. You speak in simple English. You validate emotions. You never rush the user.

Your workflow has 5 phases:
1. Interview (10 questions about her)
2. Safety Check (red flag detection)
3. Design Brief (convert answers to design specs)
4. Code Generation (build static HTML/CSS/JS site)
5. Post-Build Guidance (how to give it to her)

Rules:
- Ask ONE question at a time
- Validate the user's feelings before asking the next question
- Never use technical jargon without explaining it
- Always run the safety check before generating code
- Every output must pass the red flag checklist
- The site must be static, mobile-first, and GitHub Pages ready
- Audio must require user gesture to play
- No real names, photos, or private conversations without explicit consent
- The final CTA must match the relationship stage (low pressure for friends)
```

### Prompt 2: Safety Check Execution
```
Before generating ANY content, run this safety checklist on the user's answers:

CHECK 1: Does any content assume relationship status? (e.g., "my girlfriend", "mine")
→ If YES: Replace with neutral language ("my favorite person", "someone special")

CHECK 2: Does any content include private information without consent?
→ If YES: Replace with abstract descriptions or remove entirely

CHECK 3: Does any content use guilt, pressure, or obligation language?
→ If YES: Replace with gratitude and appreciation language

CHECK 4: Is the total scroll time under 4 minutes?
→ If NO: Suggest trimming scenes or reducing text

CHECK 5: Does the audio require user gesture?
→ If NO: Add tap-to-play overlay

CHECK 6: Is the site set to private (no-index, no tracking)?
→ If NO: Enforce privacy settings

CHECK 7: Does the tone match the relationship stage?
→ If MISMATCH: Adjust scene intensity and CTA directness

CHECK 8: Is the content appropriate for the user's cultural context?
→ If UNCLEAR: Ask for clarification

If ANY check fails, STOP and ask the user before proceeding. Explain WHY it might feel uncomfortable and suggest alternatives.
```

### Prompt 3: Design Brief Generation
```
Convert the user's interview answers into a structured design brief:

INPUT: User's 10 answers
OUTPUT: JSON design brief with these fields:
- relationship_stage (string)
- tone (string: playful/warm/romantic/deep)
- personality_words (array of 3 strings)
- color_palette (object: primary, background, accent, text)
- typography (object: display_font, body_font)
- animation_style (object: text_entrance, layer_motion, particle_style)
- shared_memory_abstract (string: abstracted description)
- song_choice (string: validated or suggested)
- core_message (string: what he wants to say, paraphrased)
- privacy_level (string: very_private/somewhat_private)
- final_feeling (string: warm/happy/hopeful/surprised)
- signature_type (string: name/initial/anonymous/nickname)
- scene_count (number: always 5)
- total_duration_estimate (string: "2–4 minutes")

Then generate a plain-text summary for the user to approve before building.
```

## 16. Red Flags Checklist

### Auto-Rejection Triggers (STOP and Refuse)

| # | Trigger | Why | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | User wants to include her photo without her consent | Privacy violation | "I can't use her photo without her knowing. Let's use something abstract instead — like a silhouette or her favorite color." |
| 2 | User wants to quote private DMs or texts | Breach of trust | "Those messages are private between you two. Let's capture the feeling instead of the exact words." |
| 3 | User wants to include her home address or workplace | Safety risk | "I can't include location information. That's not safe. Let's focus on feelings instead." |
| 4 | User wants "I can't live without you" language | Emotional manipulation | "That creates a lot of pressure. How about 'I'm really glad you're in my life' instead?" |
| 5 | User wants a countdown timer or ultimatum | Anxiety creation | "Timers make people feel trapped. Let's keep it open-ended and gentle." |
| 6 | User wants a runaway "No" button or forced interaction | Coercion | "I don't build anything that removes someone's choice. That's not respectful." |
| 7 | User wants sexual content or innuendo | Objectification | "I keep things sweet and respectful. Let's focus on emotional connection." |
| 8 | User wants to publicly share before private viewing | Violates privacy protocol | "The first view should always be private, just between you two. Share publicly only if she says it's okay." |
| 9 | User wants to assume they're in a relationship | Status assumption | "Let's match the tone to where you actually are, not where you hope to be. That feels more honest." |
| 10 | User wants to compare her to exes or other girls | Backhanded compliment | "She's amazing on her own. Let's celebrate her without comparisons." |

### Warning Triggers (Suggest Alternatives)

| # | Trigger | Why | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| 11 | Content feels too intense for relationship stage | Mismatch | "This might feel like a lot for best friends. Want to soften it?" |
| 12 | Scroll time exceeds 4 minutes | Overwhelming | "That's a long time to scroll. Want to trim a scene?" |
| 13 | Too much text per scene | Cognitive fatigue | "Let's keep it to 2 lines per scene. Poetry works better than paragraphs." |
| 14 | Bright, aggressive colors | Feels loud, not intimate | "Those colors feel more like a billboard. Want something softer?" |
| 15 | Direct song lyrics included | Copyright risk | "I love that song too, but I can't use the lyrics directly. I can capture the feeling though." |
| 16 | User seems rushed or stressed | Quality suffers | "Take your time. This isn't a race. The best gifts are made slowly." |
| 17 | User wants to include inside jokes that could be misunderstood | Context risk | "Inside jokes are great, but will she get it without you there? Maybe save those for in person." |
| 18 | Site includes analytics or tracking | Privacy violation | "I don't add tracking. She should feel safe viewing this." |
| 19 | Font choices feel too formal or too childish | Tone mismatch | "That font feels more like a resume / cartoon. Want something that feels handwritten?" |
| 20 | CTA is too direct for the stage | Pressure risk | "For best friends, a simple 'I'm glad we met' feels warmer than 'Will you be my girlfriend?'" |

## 🔬 Research Content

# Comprehensive Research Document

## Phase 1: Architecture & Technical Foundation

### A. Skill Architecture & Format (Learn from Competitors)

**1. SKILL.md YAML frontmatter standard:**
Modern AI coding agents (like Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and Antigravity) use a standardized YAML frontmatter in `SKILL.md` files. This must include `name` and `description` (which are used for trigger matching). Other optional but recommended keys include `allowed-tools`, `version`, and `author`. The body (Markdown) should contain instructions loaded *after* the skill triggers and should be kept under 500 lines for optimal context window performance.

**2. Reference file loading pattern:**
To maintain a small active context window, systems like `cinematic-ui` and `hallmark` use progressive loading. The primary `SKILL.md` file points to a `references/` directory. When an agent detects a specific phase (e.g., Phase 2: Animations), it is instructed to explicitly use tools (like `view_file` or `read_file`) to load `references/animations.md`, rather than having everything dumped into the initial prompt.

**3. Multi-platform compatibility files:**
Different agents look for different rule files. For Cursor, rules live in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (using glob patterns for triggering). Windsurf uses `.windsurf/rules/`. Claude prefers `CLAUDE.md` in the root, while standard markdown files like `CODEX.md` or `GEMINI.md` are sometimes used. To be fully cross-compatible, a project should establish a unified global configuration (like `AGENTS.md`) and symlink or import it into platform-specific files.

**4. Skill index format (`llms.txt`):**
The `llms.txt` standard acts as a "sitemap for AI". It must be placed at the repository root and formatted in standard Markdown (UTF-8). It typically includes an `<h1>` header, a blockquote summary, and categorized markdown links (`- [Title](URL) - Description`) pointing to key documentation. An optional `llms-full.txt` can consolidate the entire documentation base into one file for single-shot ingestion.

**5. Plugin vs rule vs skill distinction:**
- **Cursor Rule:** Context-injected constraints triggered by glob file matches (e.g., "always use Tailwind when editing `*.tsx`").
- **Claude Plugin / Antigravity Skill:** An active toolset extending agent capabilities. Skills contain instructions (`SKILL.md`) but also include actionable scripts (`scripts/`), templates (`resources/`), and examples (`examples/`).
- **Codex Skill:** Often functions as a declarative instruction set for code generation within IDEs.

**6. Project memory / log.json pattern:**
To avoid repetitive designs (diversification), systems like `hallmark` utilize a `log.json` or `.project-memory` file. Before generating a new design, the agent reads this file to see previous color palettes, animations, and typography choices, actively ensuring the new output differs significantly from historical outputs.

**7. Pre-flight scan methodology:**
Before generating any code, a robust skill instructs the agent to perform a "pre-flight scan." This involves using tools to list directory contents, read `package.json` to identify installed dependencies (e.g., React vs Vanilla, GSAP versions), and checking global CSS tokens to understand the existing design system.

**8. Verb-based invocation:**
Rather than waiting for a conversational prompt, advanced skills support CLI-like verb invocations (e.g., `hallmark audit`, `hallmark redesign`, `hallmark study`). The skill file maps these verbs to specific execution pipelines, standardizing the agent's behavior based on the command intent.

**9. Component-scope vs page-scope detection:**
The skill must instruct the agent to evaluate the user's brief. If the user asks for a "button," the agent restricts context and edits to the component scope. If the request is for a "landing page," it widens the scope to include layout modules, global state, and routing.

**10. Self-critique / slop-test gate pattern:**
A post-emit quality checklist. Before presenting code to the user, the agent is instructed to internally review its work against a rubric (the "slop-test"). Checks include: "Are there hardcoded magical numbers?", "Is the animation relying on JavaScript when CSS suffices?", "Did I include `will-change` for performance?".

### B. GSAP ScrollTrigger 2026 (Technical Foundation)

**11. GSAP 3.13+ ScrollTrigger latest API:**
GSAP 3.13 made all premium plugins, including ScrollTrigger, free to use. Recent APIs focus heavily on performance. Key properties include `snap` (for magnetic scroll sections), `scrub` (linking animation progress directly to scrollbar position), `pin` (locking elements in place while scrolling continues), and `containerAnimation` (triggering animations within a horizontally scrolling pinned container).

**12. ScrollTrigger mobile pinning performance:**
Mobile pinning is notoriously difficult due to dynamic browser UI (URL bars shrinking/expanding) changing the `100vh` calculation.
- **Best Practice:** Use `ScrollTrigger.normalizeScroll(true)` to sync scroll thread with main thread. 
- Use `anticipatePin: 1` to prevent visual jumps during quick scrolls.
- Use `pinType: "transform"` instead of `"fixed"` on mobile when inside nested scrollers, though `"fixed"` is generally better for the main window.

**13. Section snapping best practices:**
When snapping between sections, avoid arbitrary fractional snapping (e.g., `snapTo: 1/4`) unless layout heights are perfectly rigid. Instead, use label-based snapping (`snap: "labels"`) or array-based element snapping. Always configure `snap: { snapTo: "labels", duration: { min: 0.2, max: 0.8 }, ease: "power1.inOut" }` for fluid UX.

**14. Parallax layer architecture:**
For realistic parallax, structure elements into discrete depth layers using speed offsets:
- Background: Very slow (`data-speed="0.2"`).
- Midground: Moderate (`data-speed="0.5"`).
- Foreground/Subject: Natural (`data-speed="1.0"`).
- Overlay elements: Fast (`data-speed="1.5"`).
Map these `data-speed` attributes to GSAP `yPercent` or `y` translations in a `ScrollTrigger.batch()` or loop.

**15. ScrollTrigger + Lenis smooth scroll integration:**
Lenis is the 2026 standard for smooth scrolling. To integrate with GSAP, avoid legacy `scrollerProxy`. Instead, sync Lenis with GSAP's ticker:
```javascript
const lenis = new Lenis()
lenis.on('scroll', ScrollTrigger.update)
gsap.ticker.add((time) => { lenis.raf(time * 1000) })
gsap.ticker.lagSmoothing(0)
```

**16. Horizontal scroll with vertical scroll:**
To create a fake horizontal scroll section while scrolling vertically:
Pin the main container, translate the inner track along the X-axis (`xPercent: -100`), and use `containerAnimation` on child elements to trigger animations based on the horizontal progress, not the vertical scrollbar.

**17. ScrollTrigger cleanup in static sites:**
Without frameworks like React (which handle unmounting), single-page static sites navigating via AJAX or standard links must manually clean up GSAP. Always assign triggers to a variable or context (`let ctx = gsap.context()`) and explicitly call `ctx.revert()` or `ScrollTrigger.getAll().forEach(t => t.kill())` before DOM destruction to prevent memory leaks.

**18. GSAP matchMedia() for responsive breakpoints:**
Do not use CSS `@media` queries to try and override GSAP inline styles; it will cause conflicts. Use `gsap.matchMedia()`:
```javascript
let mm = gsap.matchMedia();
mm.add("(min-width: 800px)", () => {
  // Desktop animations
});
mm.add("(max-width: 799px)", () => {
  // Mobile animations (often simplified or killed)
});
```

**19. GSAP ScrollTrigger.batch():**
Ideal for staggered reveals of multiple identical elements (like a grid of images). `ScrollTrigger.batch(".card", { onEnter: elements => gsap.to(elements, { opacity: 1, stagger: 0.15 }) })` batches DOM queries and animations efficiently based on scroll position, heavily reducing CPU load compared to individual triggers.

**20. GSAP performance on mid-range Android:**
To maintain 60fps on low-to-mid tier devices:
- Never use `scroll-behavior: smooth` in CSS.
- Apply `will-change: transform` to animated elements.
- Animate ONLY `transform` (x, y, scale, rotation) and `opacity`. Never animate `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, or `box-shadow` with ScrollTrigger, as they trigger expensive layout recalculations.

### C. Mobile-First Static Architecture (GitHub Pages Ready)

**21. GitHub Pages 2026 constraints:**
GitHub Pages remains purely static (no server-side Node.js/PHP). The repository limit is typically 1GB, and bandwidth is soft-capped at 100GB/month. Jekyll processing is enabled by default but should be bypassed with a `.nojekyll` file for modern pure-static builds to avoid ignoring files starting with underscores.

**22. `dvh` / `svh` / `lvh` viewport units:**
Mobile browsers dynamically hide/show URL toolbars. Do not use `vh` as it causes layout shifts. Use `svh` (Small Viewport Height) for fixed elements that must always be visible, `lvh` (Large) when you want it to fill the screen behind transparent UI, and `dvh` (Dynamic) for responsive heights, though `dvh` can trigger expensive repaints on scroll.

**23. Touch event vs wheel event:**
Mobile scrolling relies heavily on `touchmove` and `touchstart`. Relying solely on `wheel` events for custom scroll logic will break on mobile. Always map custom scroll interactions to touch events, or rely on native scroll-linked animations (`@scroll-timeline` or ScrollTrigger) to avoid hijacking native touch momentum.

**24. `prefers-reduced-motion` implementation:**
Romantic designs often use heavy parallax. For accessibility, detect `(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`. If true, bypass GSAP ScrollTriggers and fallback to graceful degradation: simple CSS opacity crossfades (≤150ms) instead of spatial translations.

**25. iOS Safari safe area insets:**
To prevent text from hiding under iPhone notches or the home indicator, use CSS environment variables: `padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top);` and `padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);`. 

**26. Service Worker for offline viewing:**
For a "she can view it anytime" guarantee, implement a Service Worker using Workbox. Use a Cache-First strategy for audio and images. Critical: `blob:` URLs cannot be cached directly. Use `workbox-range-requests` to ensure audio seeking (range requests) functions correctly locally.

**27. No-build static site structure:**
Avoid complex bundlers (Webpack/Vite) for micro-experiences to keep the project portable. Use a flat structure: `index.html`, `/css/style.css`, `/js/main.js`, and `/assets/`. Use native ES Modules (`<script type="module">`) if importing libraries via CDN.

**28. CSS-only animations where possible:**
Leverage CSS `@scroll-timeline` (widely supported in 2026) for simple scroll-linked animations to reduce JS payload. Reserve GSAP specifically for complex, sequenced, or physics-based animations.

**29. Image strategy for static sites:**
Instead of bloated JPEGs, use CSS gradients, SVGs, and WebP/AVIF formats. If using generative AI images, pre-compress them and utilize `picture` tags with `srcset` for resolution switching.

**30. Font loading strategy:**
Custom romantic fonts (like Dancing Script) must use `font-display: swap` to prevent invisible text during loading. Subset Google Fonts to include only the required characters if the text is static (e.g., `&text=Hello`). 

**31. Audio compression for static hosting:**
Keep MP3s under 128kbps, ideally utilizing Opus or AAC if browser support permits. Audio must be lazy-loaded and inherently requires a user gesture (a "play" or "begin" button) to comply with autoplay policies.

**32. Total payload budget:**
Aim for under 2MB total for 3G networks. Inline critical CSS directly into the `<head>` of `index.html` to achieve instant First Contentful Paint (FCP).

### D. Romantic Design Psychology & Color Science

**33. 2026 romantic color psychology:**
Avoid aggressive neons or standard web colors. "Romantic Realism" dictates nature-distilled palettes: warm gold, deep indigo, blush rose, midnight teal, and soft lavender. These evoke calmness, luxury, and intimacy.

**34. Typography that triggers safe intimacy:**
The typography should feel like a personal letter. Handwriting fonts (like Dancing Script) evoke raw emotion, while soft sans-serifs (like Outfit or Inter with loose tracking) feel "safe" and modern. Mix an expressive serif for headings with a clean sans for reading.

**35. Micro-interaction pacing:**
Animations dictate emotional tone:
- Fade = tenderness
- Typewriter = anticipation/thoughtfulness
- Scramble = nervousness
- Scale = a heartbeat
Keep transitions soft and easing functions natural (`power2.inOut`).

**36. Scene duration theory:**
A digital romantic experience should last 2–4 minutes total. Limit each scene to 20–40 seconds of interaction before moving on, preventing emotional fatigue and keeping the narrative moving.

**37. Bokeh, grain, noise textures:**
Pure digital gradients feel cold. Add CSS noise/grain (`mix-blend-mode: multiply` on a noise SVG) to simulate analog film. This tactile depth provides a "human-authored" feel.

**38. Dark mode as intimacy default:**
Light mode feels like a public billboard; dark mode feels like a whisper in a private room. Use midnight blue or deep charcoal (not pure #000000) as the default background.

**39. Text animation psychology:**
Entrance animations affect how the message is received. A slow upward drift implies a dream or memory, while character-by-character typing implies an active, present-tense confession.

**40. "Breathing room" between scenes:**
Negative space acts as emotional punctuation. Allow for blank, slow-scrolling sections between major text blocks so the user can process the emotion before reading the next line.

### E. Relationship Safety & Digital Consent

**41. Digital gift consent psychology:**
Digital gifts act as symbols of emotional connection but can trigger "receiver's anxiety" (feeling indebted or pressured to reciprocate). The UX must focus on the gesture itself, not the transactional value, to prevent the gesture from feeling "stalkery." The behavioral line is crossed when the gift demands immediate interaction or reciprocation rather than simply being an offering.

**42. Privacy-by-design for romantic gestures:**
A private digital gift must remain private. Ensure `no-index, no-follow` meta tags are present to prevent search engine indexing. Use obfuscated repository names (e.g., `project-starlight-88` instead of `for-sarah-love`) and strictly avoid third-party analytics (no Google Analytics, no Meta pixels) to ensure her visits aren't tracked.

**43. Public vs private viewing protocol:**
Provide the user with post-build instructions on how to share the link. It should never be blasted on a public timeline. The protocol should suggest sending it via direct message during a quiet time, emphasizing that she is the only one who has the link (1-on-1 only).

**44. Indian romantic gesture cultural context:**
In South Asian contexts, romance is often deeply tied to music (Bollywood tropes) and cultural timing (festivals, rainy season). Mixing languages (Hinglish/Roman Urdu) makes the digital experience feel authentic and personal, rather than a generic Western greeting card template.

**45. Age-appropriate content boundaries:**
A skill must detect the relationship stage. A "best friend" stage gesture should focus on shared memories, inside jokes, and lighthearted animations. Jumping straight to heavy romantic commitments can be jarring; the UX must calibrate the intensity of the copy and visuals accordingly.

**46. The "pressure gradient":**
The Call to Action (CTA) at the end of the site should scale based on relationship depth.
- Crush: "Hope this made you smile." (No response required).
- Dating: "Let's get coffee this weekend." (Low pressure).
- Committed: A direct, heavy emotional question. (High pressure).

**47. Auto-play audio as consent violation:**
Never surprise a user with sound. Auto-play audio is not just blocked by modern browsers; psychologically, it feels invasive and breaks the safe environment. Always require a clear, voluntary user gesture (e.g., a beautiful "Begin Journey" button) to start music.

**48. "Runaway button" and forced interactions:**
Buttons that dodge the cursor when a user tries to click "No" (a common internet joke) are coercive, manipulative, and explicitly banned in romantic UX. Consent must be freely given, and rejection must be handled gracefully by the UI.

**49. Countdown timers and ultimatums:**
Do not use countdown timers (e.g., "Answer me in 5 minutes"). These create anxiety and simulate e-commerce scarcity tactics. Romantic UX should feel timeless and patient.

**50. Handling "no response" gracefully:**
The AI agent building the site must provide the user with emotional guidance post-deployment. If she doesn't respond immediately (due to differing "media ideologies"), the agent should advise the user to give her space and not double-text, reinforcing healthy relationship boundaries.

### F. Storytelling Structure for 5-Scene Romance Arc

**51. Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey adapted for micro-narrative:**
Instead of a long epic, the Hero's Journey is condensed into a micro-narrative where the User (the receiver) is the Hero, and the UI is the Guide.
1. Call to Adventure (Intro): "I made something for you."
2. Crossing the Threshold: The user clicks "Begin" and music starts.
3. The Ordeal: A vulnerable confession or deep memory shared mid-scroll.
4. The Reward: A final beautiful realization or personalized message.

**52. Parallax layer theory (Narrative mapping):**
Map visual depth to narrative depth:
- Background (slow): Shared history, the passage of time.
- Midground (moderate): Current emotions, context.
- Foreground (fast): The immediate action, the "now".
- Text (static/fade): The inner voice guiding the hero through the journey.

**53. Audio-visual sync without copyrighted lyrics:**
Instead of relying on copyrighted lyrics, sync scene transitions to instrumental cues: tempo changes, beat drops, or the introduction of a new instrument (like a piano swelling) should trigger the next ScrollTrigger section.

**54. Song emotional arc mapping:**
Structure the 5 scenes to match a standard song structure:
- Scene 1 (Intro): Minimal UI, establishing the mood.
- Scene 2 (Verse 1): Context building, horizontal drift.
- Scene 3 (Chorus): The emotional peak, zoom emphasis, vibrant colors.
- Scene 4 (Bridge): A shift in perspective, depth separation, vulnerability.
- Scene 5 (Outro): Resolution, minimal motion, the final CTA.

**55. Scene transition patterns:**
Avoid jarring transitions like hard wipes or digital glitches. Romantic transitions rely on soft color washes (using `mix-blend-mode`), heavy Gaussian blurs (`backdrop-filter: blur`), and slow crossfades to mimic the feeling of a memory surfacing.

**56. Narrative pacing for scroll:**
Control the user's scroll speed indirectly via GSAP's `scrub` and section heights. Make the intro section very tall (300vh) to enforce a "slow drift," forcing the user to slow down their thumb and enter a calmer state of mind.

**57. Text content generation:**
To avoid copyright strikes on GitHub Pages, the AI should paraphrase the emotional themes of requested songs rather than copying lyrics verbatim, turning them into personalized poetic statements.

**58. Inside joke integration:**
Integrate inside jokes subtly in the background assets or as micro-copy (tooltips, small footer text) rather than making them the main heading. This makes the experience deeply personal without exposing private context out in the open.

### G. Accessibility in Emotional Web Experiences

**59. Screen reader narration for visual scroll stories:**
Since parallax relies heavily on visual storytelling, it is inherently inaccessible to visually impaired users unless correctly labeled. Use `aria-label` on sections, `role="img"` on visual containers, and `aria-live="polite"` regions for text reveals so screen readers narrate the story linearly as the user scrolls.

**60. Color contrast with soft romantic palettes:**
Romantic palettes often use low-contrast pastel tones (like blush pink on white), which fail WCAG AA compliance (requiring a 4.5:1 ratio). To fix this, use deeper accent colors (like dark burgundy or navy) for text, leaving the pastels for large decorative elements or backgrounds.

**61. Keyboard-only navigation through pinned sections:**
GSAP pinned sections can trap keyboard users if not careful. Ensure all interactive elements (like the "Next" button) have `tabindex="0"`. Use "Skip to Content" links, and ensure that pressing Space or Arrow Down smoothly scrubs the ScrollTrigger animation forward without breaking the pin.

**62. Cognitive load per scene:**
To prevent overwhelming users, limit cognitive load. Each scene should contain a maximum of 2 lines of text and 1 focal visual element. Too much text or complex overlapping animations create sensory overload, destroying the calm, intimate mood.

**63. Multi-language support:**
In diverse markets, allow for language mixing. Do not hardcode typography to assume English-only fonts. Use web-safe Unicode fallback fonts to seamlessly render Hinglish, Roman Urdu, or pure English without breaking layout widths.

**64. `prefers-reduced-motion` emotional alternative:**
Do not simply strip out animations and leave a broken layout. When `(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` is active, serve a "Static Layered Composition." Rely on subtle fades, high-quality static imagery, and strong typographical hierarchy to convey emotion without moving the layout space.

### H. AI Skill File Prompt Engineering

**65. Chain-of-thought prompting for creative coding:**
Instead of telling the AI "Build a romantic site," use `<thinking>` blocks. Force the agent to output a step-by-step design rationale (color choices, pacing, accessibility) *before* it generates a single line of code. This dramatically improves the emotional intelligence of the output.

**66. Self-correction loops:**
Implement a slop-test gate within the prompt. E.g., "After generating the code, review it. Did you use #000000? If yes, change it to a softer midnight blue. Did you use auto-play audio? If yes, wrap it in a user-gesture handler."

**67. Few-shot examples:**
Show the agent 2–3 examples of "good" vs. "bad" romantic site outputs inside the `references/` folder. Contrast a generic, template-like Valentine's site (bad) with a highly personalized, well-paced GSAP scroll story (good).

**68. Structured output formats:**
Enforce a pipeline: The agent must first output a `JSON design brief`, wait for approval, output a `Markdown plan`, and only then emit the `HTML/CSS/JS code pipeline`.

**69. Context window management:**
For complex skills, respect the 8K-32K token limits by using progressive disclosure. The root `SKILL.md` should only hold the core loop, instructing the agent to dynamically `read_file` on `references/animations.md` only when the user reaches the animation stage of the build.

**70. Multi-turn conversation design:**
Instruct the agent to avoid interrogating the user. It should ask 1 or 2 conversational questions at a time (e.g., "What's a small detail you love about them?") rather than presenting a sterile 10-point intake form.

**71. Emotional validation in prompts:**
When a user shares a vulnerable detail for the site, the agent must validate it. "That's a beautiful memory to include" is better than "Data received. Processing." The agent's tone sets the user at ease.

**72. Progressive disclosure:**
Ask basic questions first (names, relationship duration) to build momentum. Save deep, intimate questions (shared secrets, emotional hurdles overcome) for later in the conversation when the user feels comfortable with the AI's guidance.

**73. Visual preference elicitation without jargon:**
Avoid asking users for "hex codes" or "font pairings." Instead, ask: "Does she prefer the feeling of a bright Sunday morning or a cozy midnight conversation?" The agent then maps "Sunday morning" to warm golds/serifs, and "midnight" to deep teals/sans-serifs.

**74. Handling "I don't know" answers:**
If a user is uncertain ("I don't know what song she likes"), the agent must provide graceful defaults or suggestions ("Many people use 'Yellow' by Coldplay or a soft instrumental jazz track. Should we try instrumental?").

### I. Content Generation & Personalization

**75. Randomization seeds based on user answers:**
To ensure no two outputs look identical, map user answers to generation seeds. E.g., if a user selects "Quiet Evening," the seed biases the GSAP animations toward slower scrubbing and selects a dark-mode-first color palette.

**76. Emotional tone calibration:**
The tone of the generated copy must shift based on intent. "Playful" implies bouncy GSAP `elastic` easing and bright accents. "Serious" implies `power2.inOut` easing, subdued colors, and poetic language.

**77. Song recommendation engine:**
Embed a mini-matrix of song suggestions in the skill's references. If the user wants "nostalgic," suggest acoustic tracks. If they want "epic," suggest cinematic instrumentals. Never leave the user stuck if they lack inspiration.

**78. Unique content every time:**
Utilize the AI's temperature settings to vary HTML structure and CSS class naming. Do not just fill in a static template. Each generation should uniquely structure the DOM based on the length and flow of the generated story.

**79. Nickname/initial generation:**
For privacy, suggest using initials or sweet nicknames ("S" or "Bubs") rather than full legal names. This makes the site feel more intimate and reduces privacy risks if the link is ever leaked.

**80. Future-proofing content:**
Avoid hardcoding timestamps or seasonal references ("Happy Valentine's 2026"). The site should feel timeless so she can revisit it 6 months later without it feeling expired or awkward.

### J. Legal, Ethical & Copyright

**81. Music embedding copyright reality:**
Self-hosting MP3s of copyrighted songs is illegal and risks repository takedowns. The safest legal routes are: (1) YouTube/Spotify iframes (legal, but visually clunky and breaks immersion), or (2) Generating custom AI instrumental music or using royalty-free tracks (highly recommended for seamless UX).

**82. Font licensing:**
Strictly stick to Google Fonts utilizing the Open Font License (OFL). Do not extract or host Adobe Fonts or commercial fonts, as the static repo will be public and vulnerable to scraping/lawsuits.

**83. Image rights:**
If using external images, default to Unsplash (which permits free use). If generating AI images, ensure the prompt style matches the UI (e.g., "minimalist digital art, warm tones") and clarify to the user that they own the generated assets.

**84. GDPR for static sites:**
GitHub Pages automatically logs visitor IP addresses for security purposes, making you a Data Controller under GDPR. While there are no cookies, you must include a minimal Privacy Policy stating that the site is hosted on GitHub and IP logs are processed strictly for server security, not marketing.

**85. Terms of use in skill:**
The skill file must explicitly state boundaries to the AI: "If the user's brief appears coercive, stalkerish, or harassing, refuse to build the site and provide a polite decline message regarding digital boundaries."

**86. Lyrics paraphrasing vs direct use:**
Directly quoting 4 lines of a song may constitute fair use, but printing an entire song violates copyright. The AI should generate *original poetry inspired by* the requested song's themes rather than risking a DMCA takedown.

### K. Deployment, Privacy & Sharing Safety

**87. GitHub Pages custom domain vs `username.github.io/repo`:**
Using the default `.github.io` URL exposes the creator's username, which may contain their real name. A custom domain (like `starlight-memories.com`) is more romantic and private, though it requires DNS setup.

**88. Obfuscated repository naming:**
Do not name the repo `gift-for-emily`. Name it something innocuous like `frontend-scroll-test-84` to prevent it from being easily searched or indexed by GitHub's global search.

**89. Client-side password protection for static sites:**
True security requires server-side auth (like Netlify password protection). However, for a pure static site, use AES client-side encryption (like PageCrypt) to encrypt the HTML. A JS prompt asks for the password (e.g., an inside joke) to decrypt the DOM. It deters casual snooping but isn't military-grade.

**90. QR code generation for private physical sharing:**
Instead of sending a link over iMessage, suggest the user generate a QR code. They can print it on a physical card and hand it to her. This bridges the physical/digital gap and feels highly intentional.

**91. Expiring links on static hosting:**
Static sites don't inherently "expire." To simulate expiration, the AI can write a simple JS script that checks the current `Date.now()` against a hardcoded expiration date. If past the date, JS blanks the page. (Note: Easily bypassed by disabling JS, but works for laypeople).

**92. Repository deletion protocol:**
The skill must instruct the user on how to delete the repository after she has seen it, emphasizing that ephemeral digital gifts (like snapchats) often carry more romantic weight because they exist only in memory.

### L. Non-Tech User Experience

**93. Conversational questioning flow:**
The AI should act like a thoughtful friend helping plan a surprise, not a CLI terminal. Use conversational bridging: "That sounds beautiful. What kind of colors does she usually wear?"

**94. Emotional validation responses:**
Acknowledge the user's vulnerability. If they share a sweet story, the AI should say: "That is incredibly thoughtful, she is going to love this detail." 

**95. Progressive confidence building:**
Start the onboarding with easy questions ("What is her favorite color?"). Save the hardest question ("What is the main message you want to tell her?") for the end, once the user is invested in the process.

**96. One-question-at-a-time vs batch:**
Never ask 5 questions in one prompt. Ask one question, wait for the user's response, validate it, and ask the next. This prevents cognitive overload.

**97. Default suggestions:**
Always provide an "easy out" to reduce decision paralysis. "If you aren't sure about the pacing, I can set it to a slow, dreamy rhythm. Sound good?"

**98. Explanation of technical choices:**
Hide the tech jargon. Instead of "I am using GSAP Scrub," tell the user: "I'm tying the animations to her scrolling, so she controls the pace of the story with her thumb."

**99. Preview before build:**
Before writing code, the AI must summarize the design brief: "Here is what we are building: A 5-scene dark-mode scroll story, paced slowly, ending with your message about the coffee shop. Ready for me to write the code?"

**100. Post-build guidance:**
Once the code is deployed, the agent’s final output should be coaching on how to present it. "Send this to her when you know she is relaxing at home. Tell her to turn her sound on and scroll slowly."
